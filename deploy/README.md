# Deploying Vectora

The stack in this directory runs the production image that
[`builds.yml`](../.github/workflows/builds.yml) publishes to
`ghcr.io/absolute-insight/simcrm` on every push to `main`. It is
[frappe_docker](https://github.com/frappe/frappe_docker)'s canonical layout:
one image, one role per container.

**Status: authored and reviewed, not yet exercised.** This configuration has
not been booted end-to-end — the environment it was written in has no Docker
daemon, and the image itself first exists after `main` receives a release and
`builds.yml` runs. Treat the first boot as part of the rollout, not as a
formality.

## Prerequisites

- A host with Docker Engine 24+ and the compose plugin
- DNS for your site name pointing at the host
- The image published (merge to `main`, wait for the **Build Container Image**
  workflow) — or build locally with frappe_docker and tag it to match

## First boot

```bash
cd deploy
cp .env.example .env        # fill in SITE_NAME, DB_ROOT_PASSWORD, ADMIN_PASSWORD
docker compose up -d
docker compose logs -f create-site   # one-shot; wait for it to finish
```

Then browse `http://<host>:8080` (or your `HTTP_PUBLISH_PORT`) — the CRM is at
`/crm`. Log in as `Administrator` with the admin password from `.env`.

`create-site` is idempotent: it skips itself when the site directory already
exists, so `docker compose up -d` is always safe to re-run.

## TLS

This stack does not terminate TLS. Put your standard reverse proxy (Traefik,
Caddy, nginx with certbot) in front of the `frontend` service and forward to
`HTTP_PUBLISH_PORT`. If you already run frappe_docker's Traefik overlay,
`frontend` here is the same nginx it expects.

## Upgrading

```bash
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d                      # replaces containers on the new image
docker compose exec backend bench --site all migrate
```

Order matters: migrate *after* the new image is up, so patches run on the code
that shipped them. `merge_duplicate_rep_plan_weeks` and friends are one-shot
frappe patches and track themselves — re-running migrate is safe.

## Backups

```bash
docker compose exec backend bench --site all backup --with-files
```

Backups land in the `sites` volume under `<site>/private/backups`. Copy them
off the host; a backup on the machine it protects is a copy, not a backup.

## Operating the proactive tier

- The **scheduler** container is what makes Vectora proactive: the hourly
  signal run, hourly deal-health scoring, and the daily digest all fire from
  it. If suggestions go quiet, check `docker compose logs scheduler` first.
- Deterministic automation (CRM Automation Rule) runs with the agent tier
  disabled — that is a design guarantee, not an accident. You can pilot with
  the agent off and lose only the model-drafted content.
- Report digests email deal values. Recipients are validated to be enabled
  users with a CRM role, but *which* users get digests is an ops decision —
  review `CRM Report Digest` records before enabling outbound email.
- Outbound email needs an Email Account configured in Frappe as usual;
  nothing in this compose file sends mail on its own.

## What this is not

A high-availability setup. One database, no replicas, volumes on the host.
For a pilot with a handful of reps that is appropriate; for more, put the
database on managed infrastructure and keep the stateless services here.
